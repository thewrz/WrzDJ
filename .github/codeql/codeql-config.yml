name: "WrzDJ CodeQL Config"

# The kiosk WiFi portal (portal.py) intentionally passes user-chosen WiFi
# SSIDs and passwords to nmcli via subprocess.run with list arguments (no
# shell injection possible). CodeQL's taint analysis flags this as
# "uncontrolled command line" because user input reaches subprocess.run, but:
#   1. subprocess.run with list args prevents shell injection
#   2. _sanitize_nmcli_arg() provides defense-in-depth validation
#   3. The portal's entire purpose is to run nmcli with user-provided values
#
# Excluding the portal directory from Python analysis avoids this false
# positive while keeping all other security checks active. The portal runs
# on a single-purpose kiosk appliance (not the main backend).
